# Commands prefixed with 'kwmc' will call
# local functions corresponding to the
# kwmc syntax.

# To run a system command, use the prefix
# 'sys' and then the requested command
# e.g 'sys mvim' would open macvim

# Read file and execute commands as
# if they were written inside kwmrc.

# include filename

# e.g: bind-commands in a separate file called 'binds'
# include binds

# Create variables that can be used in the below commands.
# Variables are in file-scope and must be defined before
# they can be used. Re-definition is also possible.
# Variable names can not contain whitespace, where as
# the value can.

# define variable value

# e.g: create a variable for the hyper-key
# define hyper cmd+ctrl+alt+shift
# kwmc bind hyper-h window -f west

kwmc config tiling bsp

# Let Kwm listen for hotkeys
kwmc config hotkeys on

# Set prefix for Kwms hotkeys

# Prefix is not applied globally

# Focus-follows-mouse is temporarily disabled when
# a floating window has focus
kwmc config standby-on-float on

kwmc config mouse-follows-focus off

# Allow window focus to wrap-around
kwmc config cycle-focus screen

# Set default container split-ratio
kwmc config split-ratio 0.5

# New splits become the left leaf-node
kwmc config spawn left
